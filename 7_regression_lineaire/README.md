# Module: Statistics - Linear Regression

## Outline
This course will cover:
* Classical linear regression approach using statsmodels
* Prediction using scikit-learn
* Error metrics for regression problems
* Test/training sets, cross validation
* Regularised linear regression models

## Resources
Much of this module will follow the ideas developed in the book ["An introuction to statistical learning" by *James, Witten et al*](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/), which is available for free online. This book is a good basis for understanding the core ideas underpinning *'data science'*. It will help you understand the concepts and applications at an advanced undergraduate/masters level mathmatics. Although the excercises are in the statistical computing language **R** (not python), all of the discussion, development of ideas & concepts are language independent. If you have advanced training in mathmatics the book ["The elements of statistical learning" by *Hastie, Tibshirani et al*](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) may be more appropriate for you. It covers essentially the same topics but in greater detail and with greater mathmatical explanation. There are also associated [free online lectures](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) from the authors which may be of use.

I will refer to the book "An introuction to statistical learning" throughout these notebooks with the shorthand **ISLR**.

Some of the material in these notebooks comes from these repos:
* [scipy 2017 tutorial](https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn)

## Excercises & Tasks

Throughout the material in this repository there will be missing code and tasks which need completing.

**Excercise** Denotes essential work that will allow you to validate competences

**Task** Denotes a section to complete that will improve your understanding
